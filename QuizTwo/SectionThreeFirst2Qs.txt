Section III  Q#1
The main differences between arrow functions and regular functions are:
	Syntax: Arrow functions have a shorter syntax and do not require the function keyword.
This binding: Arrow functions do not bind their own this value, whereas regular functions have their own this value.
Arguments object: Arrow functions do not have an argument object, unlike regular functions. Instead, you can access the arguments passed to an arrow function through the operator.

Following are the ways to get an element from DOM:
`document.getElementById()` method: This method allows you to select an element using its unique ID. The method takes the ID of the element as its parameter and returns the corresponding element.
`document.querySelector()` method: This method allows you to select an element using a CSS selector. The method takes the CSS selector as its parameter and returns the first matching element.
`document.getElementsByTagName()` method: This method allows you to select elements based on their tag name. The method takes the tag name as its parameter and returns a collection of all elements with that tag name.
